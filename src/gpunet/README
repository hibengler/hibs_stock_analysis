This directory contains the lwneuralnet library itself. Type 'make'
to compile the library.

To use the library, #include "lwneuralnet.h" in your C/C++ application
and link with liblwneuralnet.a. The source code of the library is mainly
in network.c. The file generate_sigma.c is used to generate an
interpolation table for the sigmoidal function. The file it generates,
interpolation.c, is #included in network.c.
