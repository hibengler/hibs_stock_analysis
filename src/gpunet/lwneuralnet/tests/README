This directory contains a few utilities and test programs for
the lwneuralnet library. Type 'make' to compile them.

copy_network
  Copies a network file. It is much easier just to use 'cp';
  this program only exists to test the net_copy() function.

create_network
  Create a neural network. The number of neurons in each
  layer can be specified on the command line.

jolt_network
  Make small modifications to the weights of a neural network,
  using net_jolt.

show_network
  Given a .spec file (see below) and a network file, compute
  the network for all inputs in the .spec file and show
  the outputs together with the targets.

train_network
  Train a network to compute the specification in a .spec
  file (see below).

Furthermore, this directory contains a few .spec files. Such a 
file specifies input/target pairs for a neural network. They
are only intended for testing and demonstration purposes. In
a real application, the actual input/target pairs will generally
be generated from some database. See, for instance, the ocr
example application.
