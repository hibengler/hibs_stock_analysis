Lightweight Neural Network

This is a lightweight implementation of a backpropagation neural network
routine in C. It doesn't do anything fancy: no millions of different
types of neural networks, no graphical user interface, just the routines
for computing and training a backpropagation neural network.

The easiest way to use these routines in an application is to simply
drop the source (network.c, interpolation.c and lwneuralnet.h in the
source directory) in your own source tree and '#include
"lwneuralnet.h"'.  Alternatively, you can call './configure', 'make',
and (as root) 'make install' to properly install lwneuralnet in
/usr/local.  Then you can '#include <lwneuralnet.h>' and link with the
library using '-llwneuralnet'.

The files in the directory 'tests' test the operation of the library.
They also serve as example on how to use it.

The files in the directory 'ocr' form an example application: they
train and compute a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
Because of its size and stability, the training data for this
application is distributed separately.  To download it, go to
<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lwneuralnet/lwneuralnet-ocrdata-1.1.tar.gz?download>.

This is version 0.9 of the lwneuralnet library. The latest
version is always available from the lwneuralnet homepage
at SourceForge <http://lwneuralnet.sourceforge.net>.

This library, its utility programs, and example application
(i.e. everything in this distribution) are licenced under the GNU Lesser 
General Public Licence. Please see the file LICENSE for details.

Thanks goes to Robert Locke for various suggestions on improving the
code.
